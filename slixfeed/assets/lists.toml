# Filters can be used to protect or depress your life.
# 
# Before you continue reading, please realize that the news has to be treated
# as a very annoying and bad salesperson who wants to guile and trick you into
# buying something that you do not need at all.
# 
# In other words: Sometimes, you just have to hang up the phone.
# 
# "I always tell people: News is the most highly developed form of fiction."
# "The most difficult." -- Donald Pleasence as J.G. in "The News-Benders 1968".

# 
# News is no longer an information service, if it ever was. News in most of the
# world is a mean of fear.
# 
# The government regulated news agencies, private and public, are not in your
# favour. You must filter in order to avoid from subverting your mind.
# 
# Although it is recognized that the Palestinian land confiscation issue is
# indeed a problem that affects us all (i.e. confiscation of land without
# punishing).
# 
# I have worked with far right wing Israeli and Zionist news jurnalists and
# editors for over a decade, and it occurred to me, time and again, that these
# entities have published factual and fictional criticism against themselves
# (the Israeli side), in order to distract the Israeli citizenry from removing
# the government because the Israelis wanted to better their life by improving
# the life of the average citizen.
# 
# Most of my Israeli brothers and sisters are either poor or in debt, and the
# Israeli government uses the conflict against Palestinians and Israelis as one.
# 
# By observing our problems instead of your own; you are, in fact, harming us
# and yourself.
# 
# I have added keywords to deny entries that are related to the Palestinians,
# because most of the articles about the subject are meant to distract you too
# from issues that are much more closer and important to you.
# 
# If the Americans and the Europeans will concentrate on Israel or Palestine,
# never mind which side they support, instead of protecting their own freedom
# of speech and their feedom of keep and bear arms, then tomorrow, without
# their freedoms, they would not even be able to express any opinion on any
# other matter whatsoever.
# 
# If you want to harm yourself, your family and friends and the Chinese,
# Israelis, Palestinians, Tibetans, then you are free to remove the filters
# and concentrate on issues that do not really matter.
# 
# But if you really care for Chinese, Israelis, Palestinians, Tibetans, then
# you must concentrate your efforts on *your* local area, care for *your* own
# neighbours and *your* own race, for uncompromising freedom and liberty for
# all, because, otherwise, non of us might have any.
# 
# It is "all of us for all of us" or we are on our own. And it has to start
# locally. There is no other way.
# 
# You are advised to look into the keywords and share yours with us, so people
# would get the best out of this news application.
