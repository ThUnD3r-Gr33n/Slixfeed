Slixfeed is a news broker bot for syndicated news which aims to be \
an easy to use and fully-featured news aggregating bot.

Slixfeed provides a convenient access to Blogs, News websites and \
even Fediverse instances (provided they provide syndication feeds), \
along with filtering and other privacy driven functionalities.

Slixfeed is designed primarily for the XMPP communication network \
(aka Jabber). Visit https://xmpp.org/software/ for more information.

You can run your own Slixfeed instance as a client or Jabber server \
component, from your own computer, server, and even from a Linux phone \
(i.e. Droidian, Kupfer, Mobian, NixOS, postmarketOS), as well as from Termux.

All you need is one of the above and an XMPP account to connect \
Slixfeed with.

Good luck!
